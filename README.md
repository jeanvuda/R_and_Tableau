## R functions to parse Tableau workbook's XML

As I haven't come across any work done in parsing tableau workbook's XML file using R language, I would like to share this code online for people to use freely. 
Feel free to modify and use it for your own use. If I find enough time, I might create a package in the near future. 

Please feel free to add any functions you may have developed. 

Here the list of functions I am planning to explore and add:
1)Get the list of actions, workbook properties, rows-columns details, etc
2)Find a way to delete a dashboard or workbook from a tableau workbook
3) Find a way to feed a change to workbook/s
