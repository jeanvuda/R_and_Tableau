## R functions to parse Tableau workbook's XML

As I haven't come across any work done in parsing tableau workbook's XML file using R language, I would like to share this code online for people to use freely. 
Feel free to modify and use it for your own use. If I find enough time, I might create a package in the near future. 

Please feel free to add any functions you may have developed. 

You can get these functions in your R session by just running this line of code:
`source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeanvuda/R_and_Tableau/master/Scripts/s01_Functions.R")`

Here the list of features I am planning to explore and add:

+ Get the list of actions, workbook properties, rows-columns details, etc
+ Find a way to delete a dashboard or workbook from a tableau workbook
+ Find a way to feed a change to workbook/s
